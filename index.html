    <h1>dφ: <small>the normalest game system</small></h1>

    <p>dφ (pronounced <code>/dɪˈfaɪ/</code>, like <em>defy</em>) is a
      TTRPG game system based on a new kind of die: the <em>normal
      die</em> or dφ.</p>
    
    <p>Usual dice follow, ideally, a <em>uniform distribution</em>,
      i.e., every face has the same probability of coming out. Normal
      dice follow, well,
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"
      target="_blank"><em>normal distribution</em></a>, a
      mathematically defined distribution that can output any number
      between negative infinity and positive infinity, including
      non-integers such
      as <span id="random">3.141592653589793</span>&hellip; The normal
      distribution is THE most commonly occuring probability
      distribution in nature and appropriately describes complex
      phenomena that depend on the sum of many small unpredictable
      contributions&hellip; like hitting a heavily armored goblin with
      a magic sword while surrounded by a pack of wolves! Here are
      some advantages of the dφ over classical dice based systems:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fine tuning.</strong> Classical systems mostly
	behave ok in the most common and tested situations, however we
	all have stories on how nonsensical they can become in some
	not so rare cases. The truth is that a single die, be it the
	d20, the d100, or something else, cannot adequately express
	the complexity of all the situations that arise in role
	playing. The dφ, instead, is controlled by two
	parameters, <em>power</em> and <em>unpredictability</em>, that
	can be fine-tuned to achieve any desired level of
	realism&hellip; or epicism!</li>
      <li><strong>Mathematically sound, yet simple.</strong> Would you
	rather take a bonus die or a +3 modifier? Confused by the
	various factors that influence a roll? dφ was designed by
	mathematicians with the goal of being transparent for gms and
	players and having no pathological cases. It may take a few
	sessions learning and getting used to it, but soon you will
	find it much more intuitive than old systems!</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible and universal.</strong> dφ is just a
	die. You can build many different game systems around it,
	tuning them to your playing style and your campaign. With just
	a few adjustments of the parameters, you can also plug it
	inside popular game systems (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, White Wolf,
	Chaosium, &hellip) seamlessly replacing their game mechanics.
	Unlike classical dice based systems, dφ doesn't enforce a
	style on the game play: epic games stay heroic, survival games
	remain deadly, you are in control!</li>
      <li><strong>Finer grained.</strong> Ever got frustrated that
	your attack bonus hasn't budged for the past four levels? Dice
	based systems are forced to use integer modifiers, like the
	proficiency bonus in D&amp;D 5e which increases by 1 every 4
	levels. You could use a d100 for finer grained progression,
	but even then there are limits. And how would you like a
	rapier that uses 70% of your Dexterity modifier and 30% of
	your Strength modifier? Not being limited to integers, dφ can
	accommodate for any fractional modifier, making every level
	count!</li>
      <li><strong>One die to rule them all.</strong> Ok, bad argument,
	we all love dice. And yet! With dφ you will only ever need a
	single die which adapts to every situation. You may loose on
	the fetish, but your game system will gain in simplicity.</li>
      <li><strong>Fun!</strong> Yes, a die can be fun! As you read on
	you will find the concept of <em>power</em> quite familiar,
	it's indeed nearly the same as a modifier in the d20
	system. <em>Unpredictability</em>, however, is a whole new
	story that will add spice to your RPG sessions. Try it if you
	don't believe it!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ok, where's the catch? Well, despite being the most common
      probability distribution in nature, the normal distribution is
      actually difficult to emulate with a simple device like a die.
      And even if you had a marvelous analog device that generates
      perfect normal samples, you'd still have to do some rather
      complicated computations to get the final result in dφ. For this
      reason, dφ can only be used with the assistance of a digital
      device. This can be an app on your phone, or a plugin in your
      favorite VTT.<p>

    <p>This website provides you with the tools to use dφ in your
      gaming sessions.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-normal">What is a normal die?</h2>

    <p>When rolling a fair die we expect each face to come up with the
      same probability. So, for example, if we repeatedly roll a d6,
      the face 6 will come up 1 out of 6 times, i.e. with probability
      1/6. The function that associates to each outcome its
      probability is called the <em>probability distribution</em> of
      the die, so the probability distribution of the d6 is the
      function:</p>

    <figure>
      <table class="centering">
	<tr>
	  <td>1 ↦ 1/6</td><td>2 ↦ 1/6</td>
	</tr><tr>
	  <td>3 ↦ 1/6</td><td>4 ↦ 1/6</td>
	</tr><tr>
	  <td>5 ↦ 1/6</td><td>6 ↦ 1/6</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Similarly, the probability distribution of a fair die with n
      faces is the function that associates 1/n to each outcome.  This
      is called the <em>uniform distribution</em> on n elements. A
      good way to graphically represent a probability distribution is
      to draw a chart where the outcomes are lined on the x-axis and
      their probabilities are represented by bars of proportional
      area: the higher the bar, the more likely the event. For
      example, here's the chart for the uniform distribution on 6
      elements.</p>

    <binom-viz die="6" n="1"></binom-viz>
    
    <p>Here's a less boring chart showing the probability distribution
      of rolling 2d6.</p>
    
    <binom-viz die="6" n="2"></binom-viz>

    <p>Comparing the bars, we see that rolling a 7 is six times more
      likely than rolling a 2. Shocking, we know.</p>
