    <h1>dφ: <small>the normalest game system</small></h1>

    <section>
      <p>dφ (pronounced <code>/dɪˈfaɪ/</code>, like <em>defy</em>) is a
	TTRPG game system based on a new kind of die: the <em>normal
	  die</em> or dφ.</p>
      
      <p>Usual dice follow, ideally, a <em>uniform distribution</em>,
	i.e., every face has the same probability of coming out. Normal
	dice follow, well,
	a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"
	     target="_blank"><em>normal distribution</em></a>, a
	mathematically defined distribution that can output any number
	between negative infinity and positive infinity, including
	non-integers such
	as <span id="random">3.141592653589793</span>&hellip; The normal
	distribution is THE most commonly occuring probability
	distribution in nature and appropriately describes complex
	phenomena that depend on the sum of many small unpredictable
	contributions&hellip; like hitting a heavily armored goblin with
	a magic sword while surrounded by a pack of wolves! Here are
	some advantages of the dφ over classical dice based systems:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><strong>Fine tuning.</strong> Classical systems mostly
	  behave ok in the most common and tested situations, however we
	  all have stories on how nonsensical they can become in some
	  not so rare cases. The truth is that a single die, be it the
	  d20, the d100, or something else, cannot adequately express
	  the complexity of all the situations that arise in role
	  playing. The dφ, instead, is controlled by two
	  parameters, <em>might</em> and <em>swing</em>, that can be
	  fine-tuned to achieve any desired level of realism&hellip; or
	  epicism!</li>
	<li><strong>Mathematically sound, yet simple.</strong> Would you
	  rather take a bonus die or a +3 modifier? Confused by the
	  various factors that influence a roll? dφ was designed by
	  scientists with the goal of being transparent for gms and
	  players and having no pathological cases. It may take a few
	  sessions learning and getting used to it, but soon you will
	  find it much more intuitive than old systems!</li>
	<li><strong>Flexible and universal.</strong> dφ is just a
	  die. You can build many different game systems around it,
	  tuning them to your playing style and your campaign. With just
	  a few adjustments of the parameters, you can also plug it
	  inside popular game systems (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, White Wolf,
	  Chaosium, &hellip) seamlessly replacing their game mechanics.
	  Unlike classical dice based systems, dφ doesn't enforce a
	  style on the game play: epic games stay heroic, survival games
	  remain deadly, you are in control!</li>
	<li><strong>Finer grained.</strong> Ever got frustrated that
	  your attack bonus hasn't budged for the past four levels? Dice
	  based systems are forced to use integer modifiers, like the
	  proficiency bonus in D&amp;D 5e which increases by 1 every 4
	  levels. You could use a d100 for finer grained progression,
	  but even then there are limits. And how would you like a
	  rapier that uses 70% of your Dexterity modifier and 30% of
	  your Strength modifier? Not being limited to integers, dφ can
	  accommodate for any fractional modifier, making every level
	  count!</li>
	<li><strong>One die to rule them all.</strong> Ok, bad argument,
	  we all love dice. And yet! With dφ you will only ever need a
	  single die which adapts to every situation. You may loose on
	  the fetish, but your game system will gain in simplicity.</li>
	<li><strong>Fun!</strong> Yes, a die can be fun! As you read on
	  you will find the concept of <em>might</em> quite familiar,
	  it's indeed nearly the same as a modifier in the d20
	  system. <em>Swing</em>, however, is a whole new story that
	  will add spice to your RPG sessions. Try it if you don't
	  believe it!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ok, where's the catch? Well, despite being the most common
	probability distribution in nature, the normal distribution is
	actually difficult to emulate with a simple device like a die.
	And even if you had a marvelous analog device that generates
	perfect normal samples, you'd still have to do some rather
	complicated computations to get the final result in dφ. For this
	reason, dφ can only be used with the assistance of a digital
	device. This can be an app on your phone, or a plugin in your
	favorite VTT.</p>

      <p>This website provides you with the tools to use dφ in your
	gaming sessions.</p>

    <section id="what-is-normal">
      <h2>What is a normal die?</h2>

      <p>When rolling a fair die we expect each face to come up with the
	same probability. So, for example, if we repeatedly roll a d6,
	the face 6 will come up 1 out of 6 times, i.e. with probability
	1/6. The function that associates to each outcome its
	probability is called the <em>probability distribution</em> of
	the die, so the probability distribution of the d6 is the
	function:</p>

      <figure class="math"
	      style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; text-align: center">
	<span>1 ↦ 1/6</span>
	<span>2 ↦ 1/6</span>
	<span>3 ↦ 1/6</span>
	<span>4 ↦ 1/6</span>
	<span>5 ↦ 1/6</span>
	<span>6 ↦ 1/6</span>
      </figure>
      
      <p>Similarly, the probability distribution of a fair die with n
	faces is the function that associates
	<math><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> to each
	outcome.  This is called the <em>uniform distribution</em>
	on <math><mi>n</mi></math> elements. A good way to graphically
	represent a probability distribution is to draw a chart where
	the outcomes are lined on the <math><mi>x</mi></math>-axis and
	their probabilities are represented by bars of proportional
	area: the higher the bar, the more likely the event. For
	example, here's the chart for the uniform distribution on 6
	elements.</p>

      <binom-viz class="figure" die="6" n="1"></binom-viz>
      
      <p>Here's a less boring chart showing the probability distribution
	of rolling 2d6 (hover the mouse on the bars to read the
	probabilities).</p>

      <figure>
	<binom-viz id="binom-many" die="6" n="2" precompute="40"></binom-viz>
	<div class="caption">
	  <span>
	    <input type="range" min="1" value="2" max="40" step="1"
		   oninput="$('#binom-many-c').textContent = $('#binom-many').n = this.value"/>
	    <span class="animated centering" style="width: 2.5em;">
	      <span id="binom-many-c">2</span>d6
	    </span>
	  </span>
	  <label class="checkbutton">
	    <input type="checkbox" id="binom-cumulative"
		   onchange="$('#binom-many').cumulative = this.checked;">
	    <span>Cumulative</span>
	  </label>
	</div>
      </figure>
      
      <p>Comparing the bars, we see that rolling a 7 is six times more
	likely than rolling a 2. Shocking, I know. The more dice we add,
	the more the distribution concentrates in the middle. Move the
	slider above to see what happens when you roll more dice.</p>

      <p>When you roll an ability check, though, you don't really care
	about the exact number you roll. You just want to know whether
	you exceed a certain target. For example, if you're rolling a
	d20 against a difficulty class of 13, you care about the
	probability of getting 13 or more. In this case, we want to look
	at the sum of the probabilities of getting 13, 14, &hellip;,
	20. Click on the <label class="checklabel"
				for="binom-cumulative">"Cumulative"</label> button and hover the
	mouse again to show the <em>cumulative probabilities</em>,
	i.e. the probability of getting <math><mi>n</mi></math> or
	more. In either case, there is an easy visual interpretation of
	these probabilities: it is the ratio between the area colored in
	bright green and the whole area (both in bright and in pale
	green).</p>

      <p>As you increased the number of dice, you noticed that the
	probability of every single outcome gets increasingly smaller,
	the bars getting increasingly thinner (hover the mouse again if
	you're not convinced). Now imagine rolling billions of dice. The
	bars get so thin as to nearly disappear, every single one of the
	billion outcomes becoming so unlikely that observing it becomes
	hopeless. However the cumulative probabilities still go from 0%
	to 100% and we can put a number on the probability of getting an
	outcome greater than, say, 1,000,000,001.</p>

      <p>Now imagine rolling infinitely many dice! The probability of
	observing any single outcome becomes exactly
	0. Nil. Nothing. But the probability of getting an outcome
	<math><mrow><mo>≥</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>
	corresponds to the ratio between the area of the chart to the
	right of <math><mi>n</mi></math> and the area of the whole
	chart. And this quantity is measurable! This is what
	a <em>continuous probability distribution</em> is: a
	mathematical function describing the probability of getting,
	among infinitely many outcomes, one that is greater
	than <math><mi>n</mi></math>.  The <em>standard normal
	  distribution</em> is one such distribution.  Its probability
	chart is shown below. Hover the mouse to observe the cumulative
	probabilities (click and drag works too).</p>

      <norm-viz class="figure" mouse-events></norm-viz>

      <p>The normal distribution is also called <em>gaussian
	  distribution</em> in honor of German
	mathematician
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"
	   target="_blank">Carl Friedrich Gauß</a>. Its probability
	function (the curve that bounds the green area) is defined
	mathematically as</p>

      </math>

      <p>Don't worry, you don't have to remember this! It is just to
	show where the name dφ comes from: φ is a letter commonly used
	to denote the probability function of the normal
	distribution.</p>

      <p>If the shape looks familiar, it's because it is
	the <em>limit</em> distribution of
	rolling <math><mi>n</mi></math> dice (and dividing the result
	by <math><msqrt><mi>n</mi></msqrt></math>)
	as <math><mi>n</mi></math> goes to infinity. It is often
	observed in nature because the sum of many small random
	independent contributions also tends to a normal
	distribution. This is why it is perfect for modeling&hellip; the
	probability of hitting a heavily armored orc with a sword imbued
	of draconic magic!</p>

      <p>Let's review some important properties of the normal
	distribution. First, it's pretty obvious that the curve is
	symmetric with respect to the <math><mi>y</mi></math>-axis, thus
	the results will come <strong>negative 50% of the time and
	  positive the other 50%</strong>. There is no lower or upper
	limit on the distribution:
	<strong>any outcome between minus infinity and plus infinity is
	  possible</strong>; however the probability of observing a
	result far away from 0 decreases exponentially fast. Indeed,
	roughly 68.3% of the outcomes fall between -1 and 1, and
	roughly 99.7% fall between -3 and 3. The chances of falling
	outside the interval from -4 to 4 are smaller than 1 in
	10,000: you may safely assume you'll not roll such a result in
	a game session, but if you play enough you eventually will!
	Play with this slider in the chart below to see the
	probabilities of falling within various intervals.</p>

      <figure>
	<norm-viz id="norm-interval" left="-1" right="1"></norm-viz>
	<div class="centering">
	  <input type="range" min="0"  value="1" max="3" step="0.1"
		 oninput="$('#norm-interval').left = -($('#norm-interval').right = this.value)">
	</div>
      </figure>

      <p>A dφ is a "die" that rolls numbers according to the normal
	distribution. You can try rolling one by clicking on this
	button <button onclick="$('#dφ-roll').textContent =
		       Normal.sample() + '…'">roll dφ</button>
	Result: <span id="dφ-roll"></span></p>

      <p>The sequence of digits goes on literally forever, but we need
	to stop it at some point if we want to read and use the
	result. The 16 or so decimal digits output by our dφ roller are
	more than enough for all practical purposes.</p>

      <p>Like with standard dice, we may take the result of a dφ and add
	a modifier. So rolling a dφ + 4 means rolling a dφ and adding 4.
	But we will also do something a bit more unusual: multiply the
	results!  When we write <span class="nowrap">3dφ + 4</span> we
	mean rolling a dφ, multiplying the result by 3 and then adding
	4.  In dφ parlance,
	<math><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></math> is called the 
	<strong>swing</strong> of the roll, and
	<math><mrow><mi>μ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></math> is
	its <strong>might</strong>.  Both σ and μ can be non-integers.</p>

      <p>The probability distribution of rolling 
	<span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ</span> is called
	the <em>generalized normal distribution</em> of parameters 
	<math><mrow><mo form="prefix"
			stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>σ,μ</mn><mo form="postfix"
							       stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>.  Varying σ and μ does not
	really change the shape of the probability curve, it only
	squishes, stretches and shifts it along the axes. In our
	visualizations, instead of squishing/stretching/shifting the
	curve we prefer to stretch/squish/shift the axes. Play around
	with the distribution of <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ</span> in
	the chart below: modify σ and μ, roll the die and see how the
	distribution of results change.</p>

      <figure>
	<norm-viz id="gen-norm" mouse-events></norm-viz>
	<div class="caption">
	  <span>
	    <input type="range" min="-1" value="0" max="1" step="0.02"
		   oninput="$('#σ').textContent = ($('#gen-norm').σ = 9**this.value).toFixed(2)">
	    <math class="animated"><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn id="σ">1.00</mn></mrow></math>
	  </span>
	  <span>
	    <input type="range" min="-5" value="0" max="5" step=".1"
		   oninput="$('#μ').textContent = ($('#gen-norm').μ = 1*this.value).toFixed(2)">
	    <math class="animated"><mrow><mi>μ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn id="μ">0.00</mn></mrow></math>
	  </span>
	  <span>
	    <button onclick="$('#gen-norm-roll').textContent =
		    $('#gen-norm').roll() + '…'">Roll</button>
	    <span id="gen-norm-roll" style="display: inline-block;width: 20ex;"></span>
	  </span>
	</div>
      </figure>
      
      <p>Mind that when we write 3dφ we really mean "roll a dφ and
	multiply the result by 3", not "roll three dφ and add the
	results".  Indeed, one of the fundamental concepts of dφ is that
	you never need to roll more than one die.  This is because,
	unlike ordinary dice, the sum of two normal dice is again a
	normal die (with different parameters).  The mathematical
	formula that translates the sum of two normal dice to a single
	one is:</p>

      <p>Don't worry. You don't have to memorize this formula. The dφ
	tools will compute it for you. All you need to know is that you
	will never be asked to roll more than one dφ, however in some
	circumstances the gm may decide to have several players who are
	working together towards a goal roll a die each, and then add
	the results.  By applying the formula above, this choice makes
	no difference in terms of probability and lets each player
	participate to the action.</p>

      <p>This is all the theory you need to know about the dφ.  Now you
	can jump into the real deal: applying dφ to combat, skill
	checks, etc.!</p>

      <h2>dφ for players</h2>

      <p>dφ is not a complete game system, but rather a framework to
	create your own.  It can be integrated into new or existing
	game settings and adapts to many different role playing
	styles.  Think the (in)famous d20 system, but more radical.
	To help fix ideas and give concrete examples we will use a
	lightweight system based on dφ, called li-φ
	(pronounced <code>/laɪ.faɪ/</code>, like <em>lie-fy</em>)</p>

      <h3>Li-φ, a lightweight system</h3>

      <p>Li-φ is what we call a CASO system: it describes
	character's <strong>Capabilities</strong> using
	8 <strong>Attributes</strong>, an open list
	of <strong>Skills</strong> and <strong>Objects</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Attributes</strong> describe the character's
	elementary phisical, psychical and social abilities.  They
	are:</p>

      <figure style="display: grid; grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
		     grid-auto-flow: column; text-align: center;
		     font-weight: bold">
	<span>Strength</span>
	<span>Stamina</span>
	<span>Agility</span>
	<span>Reflexes</span>
	<span>Intelligence</span>
	<span>Willpower</span>
	<span>Charisma</span>
	<span>Appearance</span>
      </figure>
      
      <p>Hopefully the names speak for themselves. Attributes for
	playable characters typically range in value from -8 to 8,
	with 0 being the average.  Values outside this range are
	reserved for superhuman or supernatural traits.</p>

      <p><strong>Skills</strong> describe learned abilities that a
	character acquires through training, studying, etc.  The list
	of skills is not fixed and may vary depending on the campaign
	setting. Here's a non-exhaustive list:</p>
	
      <figure style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
		     text-align: center; font-weight: bold">
	<span>Swordfighting</span>
	<span>Atheltics</span>
	<span>Endurance</span>
	<span>Firearms</span>
	<span>Investigation</span>
	<span>Arcana</span>
	<span>Persuasion</span>
	<span>Science</span>
	<span>Intimidation</span>
      </figure>

      <p>Skill values start at 0 and may grow arbitrarily.  The
	typical playable character will cap at 12; higher values
	represent legendary (e.g., Napoleon's war-tactical acumen) or
	otherworldly proficiency in the skill.</p>

      <p><strong>Objects</strong> are tools that enable certain
	actions.  For example, a sword is necessary for swordfighting.
	Common objects will normally be just that, however some
	objects may be especially well crafted, imbued of mystic
	powers, or maybe extremely poor for the job.  Objects have a
	value that describes their quality, ranging from -4 to 4, with
	0 describing a standard object of its type.  Values outside
	this range describe unique objects or extremely unfit
	tools.</p>

      <p>The combination of attributes, skills and objects defines
	what <strong>capabilities</strong> are available to the
	characters.  Examples of capabilities are: attacking with a
	sword, firing a weapon at a target, dodging, parrying, casting
	a spell, riding a horse, climbing a wall, etc.  The list of
	capabilities is truly enormous and only a few of them will be
	written down in your character's sheet, the rest being defined
	on the fly by the gm as the need arises.</p>

      <p>Each capability has a <em>might score</em> computed from the
	attributes, skills and objects involved in it. A typical
	capability involves a <em>major</em> and a <em>minor
	attribute</em>, a skill and, eventually, an object and other
	modifiers.  The score is computed as:</p>

	<p>Clobbert makes a leaving by cheating at cards in the inns
	  of the old port town.  He is a master at stacking cards: to
	  compute his might score add his <em>agility</em> (5), half his
	  <em>charisma</em> (3/2 = 1.5) and his <em>sleight of
	  hand</em> skill (7), for a total of 13.5.  Whenever he can,
	  he uses a specially marked deck that helps him set the cards
	  in order, adding an extra +2 to the might score.</p>
      </aside>

      <p>Some capabilities may use a different combination of
	attributes and skills. See the <a href="#for-gms">gm's
	  guide</a> for more details.</p>
      
      <p>That's all. There are no classes, no levels in li-φ.  There
	are no official character creation and experience systems: the
	gm will tell you how you are allowed to assign values to
	attributes and skills, and how you can improve them as the
	story progresses.  There is no standard health system: the gm
	may opt for a hit-points based one, or for something based on
	health levels, or something else.</p>

      
      <h3 id="the-check">The check</h3>
      
      <p>At the core of dφ is <em>the check</em>: a die roll that
	decides whether or not an action attempted by one or more
	playing characters succeeds. This encompasses several rolls from
	other game systems: attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks,
	opposed rolls, etc.</p>

      <p>A check measures a character's capability against a
	<em>challenge</em>, or against another character's capability.
	So, for example, a character attacking an armored enemy with a
	sword will be resolved by pitting the character's <em>melee
	(sword)</em> capability against the enemy's <em>defense
	(armor)</em> capability.  Another character trying to climb a
	wall will roll a check for his <em>climbing</em> capability
	against the challenge posed by the wall.</p>

      <p>No matter how many characters and capabilities are involved,
	<strong>a check is always resolved by rolling a single
	  <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ</span></strong> and checking
	whether the outcome is positive or negative: positive means
	success, negative means failure.  The capabilities of all
	characters involved determine the might μ, whereas the swing σ
	usually depends on environmental factors not tied to a single
	character.  We now review both in details.</p>

      <h3 id="the-might">The might</h3>

      <p>The might represents your character's aptitude (or
	inaptitude) at the task. It is very similar to a modifier in
	the d20 system: a positive might increases your chances of
	success, a negative one decreases
	them. When <math><mrow><mi>μ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>
	the roll has 50% chances of coming out negative and 50%
	positive: this represents the typical undecided situation, the
	perfect balance between two mighty opponents, the crossroads
	where anything could happen.</p>

      <p>When attempting to overcome a passive obstacle, e.g. climbing
	a wall, finding a hidden object, etc., the gm decides
	a <em>challenge score</em> based on the difficulty of the task
	(higher is more difficult) and indicates which of your
	capabilities will be used in the check. Then <strong>the might
	of the roll is given by your capability's might score minus
	the challenge score</strong>:</p>

	  bridge and to protect their escape he decides to use his
	  rapier to cut the ropes holding it.  The ropes are thick, so
	  the gm decides the challenge score to cut them is 4.</p>
	
	<p>Jarvil's character's sheet has no preset capability that
	  fits well the situation, so the gm decides to improvise one
	  based on Jarvil's <em>strength</em> (3) plus half
	  his <em>reflexes</em> (4/2 = 2) plus
	  his <em>swordfighting</em> skill (3); Jarvil's rapier has a
	  light and flexible blade, not meant for this job, so the gm
	  decides it will have a -4 modifier.</p>

	<p>In summary, Jarvil's might score is 3 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 4. That
	  minus the challenge score of 4 makes a might of 0 for the
	  check: Jarvil has 50% chances of successfully cutting the

	<p>Jarvil's attempt at cutting the bridge was only partly
	  successful: some guards made past it and they're now engaged
	  in a fight. He attacks a royal guard with his
	  rapier. Jarvils's <em>melee (rapier)</em> capability has
	  might given by his <em>strength</em> (3) plus half
	  his <em>agility</em> (3/2 = 1.5), plus
	  his <em>swordfighting</em> skill (2) for a total of 3 + 1.5
	  + 2 = 6.5 (his rapier is just a normal rapier and has no

	  capability is given by his <em>agility</em> (2) plus half
	  his <em>reflexes</em> (0/2 = 0) plus
	  his <em>swordfighting</em> skill (3) plus his <em>light

      </aside>
      
      <p>In many situations, gms prefer to keep the opponent's might
	secret to spice up the game. In this case you will roll a
	<span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ<sub>you</sub></span> and succeed
	if your result is greater than μ<sub>opponent</sub>, which
	your gm will tell you. Chances are that after a couple of
	rolls you will have a good idea of your opponent's might.</p>

      <h3 id="the-swing">The swing</h3>
      
      <p>The swing σ controls the flow of the game by making it more
	or less predictable. A larger swing makes rolling larger
	numbers more likely, and thus diminishes the impact of the
	might.  A smaller swing makes the resolution of a check more
	dependent on the might and less on randomness. In the
	extremes, a zero swing makes checks a simple matter of
	comparing mights, whereas an infinitely large swing makes
	every check a coin toss.</p>

      <p>By default <strong>in li-φ the swing is set
	  to <span class="nowrap">σ = 8</span></strong>, we call
	this value the <em>base swing</em>.</p>
	
      <aside class="example">
	<p>Continuing Jarvil's example, his rapier attack's might was
	  determined to be <math><mo>-</mo><mn>0.5</mn></math>, so je
	  needs to roll 8dφ + 0.5 and hope to get a positive number.
	  Looking at the chart below, we see Jarvil has 52.5% chances

	  different values of the base swing would have changed

      <p><strong><em>Swing modifiers</em> change the base swing by
	  multiplying or dividing it</strong>, so a swing modifier of
	  2 changes the swing to 16.  Swing modifiers typically
	  reflect the circumstances of the check rather than the
	  capabilities of the characters. For example, if the
	  characters are fighting in the middle of an earthquake, the
	  gm may decide that all combat actions become more
	  unpredictable because of the unstable ground and apply a
	  swing modifier of ×1.5.  When several swing modifiers apply
	  at once, they are all multiplied together.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to do mental calculations with swing
	modifiers: how fast can you multiply 7 × 1.25 × 1.02 × 0.80 in
	your head? Did you even realize that 1.25 and 0.80 cancel each
	other out?  For this reason, dφ uses instead
	the <strong>hop</strong>, a <em>logarithmic unit</em>, to
	measure swing modifiers.  The symbol of the hop is ℏ.  Zero
	hops correspond to no modifier, a negative number of hops
	decreases σ, a positive number increases it. Being a
	logarithmic unit, hops add instead of multiplying, so applying
	a modifier of -3ℏ followed by one of 3ℏ totals 0ℏ, so no
	modifier at all.<p>

      <p>The chart below lets you visualize how a swing modifier
	measured in hops changes the swing.  Select an area of the
	curve with the mouse, then play with the sliders to see how
	changing the swing modifies its probability. You'll notice
	that the change rate is much more regular when playing with
	the hops slider than with the swing slider, which is one of
	the great features of using hops instead of multipliers.</p>

	<p>The reason for this choice is that
	  <math><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></math> is an important
	  constant in dφ, and that a smaller subdivision was needed
	  for finer grained control, so we took the tenth root of it.</p>
      </details>

      <p>Now that you know all the basics of the dφ, we can review the
	most important rules that affect the might and the swing.  A
	much more detailed list of rules will be given in
	the <a href="#for-gms">gm's guide</a>.  Keep in mind that most
	rules in dφ are optional, your gm will tell you which ones to
	use.</p>


      <h3 id="never-roll-twice">Never roll twice!</h3>

      <p>One of the central tenets of dφ is that every situation can
	be resolved by the roll of a single die.  Unlike in other
	systems, you will never be asked to roll two dice and add
	them, take the maximum or the minimum value.  You and your
	opponent will also never be asked to roll a die each and
	compare the results. The mechanic is always the same for every
	situation: determine mights of the participants involved, take
	their difference μ, determine the swing, and
	roll <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ</span>.  This mechanic is
	symmetric, so it doesn't matter who rolls the die.  Some gms
	like to have the players roll all dice (except secret rolls,
	maybe).</p>

      <aside class="example">
	<p>The young Chevalier de Chançon (a PC) is fighting a duel
	  with the Marquis de Fleurence (an NPC).  It is the
	  Chevalier's turn and he prods the Marquis' defenses by
	  thrusting his rapier, the Marquis reads the attack and tries
	  to deflect. Chançon's <em>attack</em> capability has might
	  score 5 (his <em>agility</em> plus half his
	  <em>strength</em> plus his <em>swordmanship</em>), Fleurence's
	  <em>parry</em> has might score 10 (his
	  <em>reflexes</em> plus half his <em>agility</em> plus
	  his <em>swordmanship</em>).  <strong>Chançon
	  rolls <span class="nowrap">8dφ - 5</span></strong> and gets
	  -0.24&hellip;, his blade slashes the air.</p>

	<p>The Marquis circle parries and ripostes aiming for
	  Chançon's open chest, Chanson tries to recover and parry.
	  Fleurence's <em>riposte</em> capability has might 8.5 (<em>agility</em>
	  plus half his <em>strength</em> plus <em>swordmanship</em>)
	  whereas Chançon's <em>parry</em> has might 4 (<em>reflexes</em> plus half his
	  <em>agility</em>
	  plus <em>swordmanship</em>).  <strong>Chançon is the PC, so
	  he rolls <span class="nowrap">8dφ - 4.5</span></strong> and
	  gets -1.32&hellip; Fleurence's blow tears Chançon's shirt
	  and scratches his chest.  The Marquis has drawn first blood,
	  Chançon will have to practice more before he can challenge
	  the Marquis again.</p>
      </aside>
	
      <p>There are several exceptions to the single roll rule, though.
	When one PC goes against another PC, the master may decide to
	have each player make a roll and compare the results, for
	increased drama.  In this case the swing of each roll is
	adjusted by -10ℏ, so that the probability of either party
	winning is exactly the same as if only one party had rolled.
	Thus the choice of who rolls is only a matter of flavor,
	without any impact on the mechanics.</p>

      <aside class="example">
	<p>The Chevalier de Chançon practices fencing with his friend
	  the Vicomte d'Orval (another PC), who wants to teach him his

	  Surprised, Chançon tries to retreat and parry.  Orval's
	  might is 6 and Chanson's is 4.  <strong>Because both are
	  playing characters</strong>, the gm instructs the players to
	  roll a die each.  After applying a modifier of -10ℏ, the
	  swing becomes roughly
	  <span class="nowrap">σ = 5.6569&hellip;</span>.
	  <strong>Chançon rolls <span class="nowrap">σdφ +

	  <strong>Orval rolls <span class="nowrap">σdφ +

	      7.01&hellip;. <em>Touché!</em> Orval's rolls is higher,
	      so his <em>botte</em> strikes on target.</p>
      </aside>
      
      <p>The gm's guide has a much more detailed explanation of how
	and why splitting and merging rolls affects the swing.  Of
	course, all these computations will be done by the Rollφ app,
	so it is not important to memorize the modifiers.  You just
	need to remember that the number of PC and NPC involved in a
	check may change the swing, but that ultimately the chances of
	success will be independent of how many people roll a die.</p>


      <h3 id="helping-pc">Helping and collaborating</h3>

      <p>Following the same philosophy, any time several characters

      <h2>dφ for gms and game designers</h2>

      <p>We now dive into the mechanics of dφ and how to use them to
	deliver an entertaining gaming experience.  Most of the rules
	we present here are optional and some of them do not even work
	well together.  Your role as gm or game designer is to choose
	the rules that fit best your campaign and your gaming style
	and to integrate them into the larger game system.  Remember:
	dφ is just a die!  It does not impose to you a setting, a list
	of classes or archetypes, a system of experience and character
	levels, hit points, weapons, characteristics, skills, powers,
	spells, etc.  These are all yours to decide: you can integrate
	dφ into a system you're already familiar with, or you can
	build your own on top of it.</p>

      <p>Although dφ strives to stay simple and intuitive, most of the
	computations involved in determining a check's difficulty are
	impossible to do mentally for almost any human.  The goal of
	this guide is to give you a deep understanding of the
	mechanics of dφ, but ultimately the Rollφ app will do the
	computations for you.</p>
      
      <p>In this guide, we keep using li-φ as a reference system. For
	guidance on how to create your system from scratch or how to
	integrate dφ into a pre-existing system,
	see <a href="#dφ-from-scratch"><em>Creating your own dφ
	system</em></a>.</p>
      
      <h3 id="what-is-a-roll">What does a check represent?</h3>

      <p>A check compares the capabilities of one or more characters
	to determine the success or failure of an action. Each
	character contributes exactly one capability: for example a PC
	may use one of his offensive capabilities against an NPC's
	defensive capability. If a capability is not already
	predefined in the character's sheet, you may have to improvise
	one, see <a href="#capabilities">Creating
	  capabilities</a>.</p>

      <p>The mechanic is always the same: for each character you
	choose a capability and compute its might, then the mights are
	combined to determine a roll. In general, you add together the
	mights of the characters that are collaborating towards the
	same goal, and subtract the mights of those that are opposing
	it.</p>

      <p>It is always possible to resolve every check with
	a <strong>single die roll</strong>. According to dφ's
	philosophy, a check functions <em>as if</em> each character
	were rolling for his own capability, but the various
	individual rolls are <em>merged into a single one</em> to
	expedite the game. In some circumstances, though, it is more
	fun to <strong>split the roll</strong> among several
	characters, so that every player gets to contribute to the
	result.  No matter whether you merge or split the rolls, the
	rules of dφ are designed so that the chances of success are
	mathematically the same, so the choice of splitting or merging
	is purely one of flavor.</p>

      <p>We now review the rules, going from the simplest to the most
	advanced check. Although the computations may look involved,
	fear not: Rollφ will compute the roll for you, so you only
	need to have an understanding of what's going on under the
	hood.</p>
      
      <h4>PC vs NPC</h4>
      
      <p>The most common and the simplest check tests a playing
	character's capability against a non-playing opponent's
	capability. Examples of checks are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A <em>Sword attack</em> against a <em>Dodge</em> in melee,</li>
	<li>A <em>Longbow attack</em> against <em>Passive defense
	    (armor)</em> for a surprise attack from distance,</li>
	<li>A dragon's <em>Poison breath</em> against <em>Resistance
	    (stamina)</em>,</li>
	<li>A wizard's <em>Hypnotize</em> spell against <em>Resistance
	    (willpower)</em>,</li>
	<li>A <em>Shove</em> against <em>Shove</em> in a brawl.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All these capability-on-capability checks are resolved in the
	same way:</p>

	  approaches her.</p>

	<p>She attracts the guard in a dark alley and casts
	  the <em>Sleep</em> spell on him, for which she has a might

	  Larietta rolls 8dφ + 4 and gets a 7. The guard will be
	  sleeping for a good while.</p>
      </aside>

      <h4>PC vs PC</h4>

      <p>When two PCs go against each other, you may proceed like in
	the PC-vs-NPC case. However your players will feel much more
	involved in the action if they both get a chance to roll.
	When <strong>splitting a roll</strong>, each PC rolls a die,
	applies the modifiers, and the higher roll wins.  We must be
	careful, though, to maintain the same chances of success for
	both players. This is how a PC-vs-PC roll is split in dφ:</p>
      
      <ol>
	<li>Determine the first PC's might
	  <math><mi>μ₁</mi></math>;</li>
	<li>Determine the second PC's might
	  <math><mi>μ₂</mi></math>;</li>
	<li>Determine the swing σ by <strong>applying a modifier of
	  -10ℏ</strong>, plus any other eventual swing modifiers;</li>
	<li>Have the first PC roll a <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ₁</span>;</li>
	<li>Have the second PC roll a <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ₂</span>;</li>
	<li>The higher roll wins.</li>
      </ol>

      <aside class="example">
	<p></p>
      </aside>
      
      <p>Why that -10ℏ swing modifier? If we didn't apply it, the
	player with the smallest might would gain an unfair advantage
	in splitting the roll. By applying the modifier we
	mathematically ensure that the chances of success for each
	character are the same as if we hadn't split the roll.</p>

      <p>But why? Let's do the maths.  Saying that the first roll is
	greater than the second is the same as saying that the first
	roll minus the second is greater than 0.  But thanks to the
	formula for combining two normal distributions:</p>
      
      <math display="block">

	    <mo>-</mo>
	    <mi>μ₂</mi>
	  </mrow>
	</mrow>
      </math>

      <p>So, a split roll with swing
	<math><mfrac><mi>σ</mi><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></mfrac></math>
	is the same as a standard roll with swing σ.  Now remember
	that <math><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></math> is 10ℏ, so
	dividing by <math><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></math> is the same
	as applying a modifier of -10ℏ, and you have the
	explanation.</p>
      
      <p>In fact, in dφ the standard PC-vs-NPC roll (which, recall,
	has by default swing <span class="nowrap">σ = 8</span>) is
	implicitly understood to be the combination of a split roll of
	the PC against the NPC (thus with
	swing
	<math><mn>8</mn><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt><mo>≈</mo><mn>5.657</mn></math>).
	But because the PC-vs-NPC roll is the most common one, dφ uses
	it as the base case, and applies modifiers to the split
	case.</p>

      <h4>PC vs static challenge</h4>
      
      <p>The same adjustment as in the PC-vs-PC case must be made when
	a character faces a challenge other than another character.
	Indeed the philosophy in dφ is that <strong>inanimated objects
	do not have capabilities</strong> and thus do not get to roll.
	Instead, they present a <em>challenge</em> measured by a
	number
 	<math><msub><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">chall</mi></msub></math>.</p>

      <p>Because only the capability of the single character is
	rolled, we apply a -10ℏ swing modifier for consistency with
	the PC-vs-PC case.  Concretely, proceed as follows:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Determine the PC's
	  might
	  <math><msub><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">PC</mi></msub></math>;</li>
	<li>Determine the challenge's
	  might
	  <math><msub><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">chall</mi></msub></math>;</li>
	<li>The roll's might is
	  <math>
	    <mi>μ</mi>
	    <mo>=</mo>
	    <msub><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">PC</mi></msub>
	    <mo>-</mo>
	    <msub><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">chall</mi></msub>
	  </math>;</li>
	<li>Determine the swing σ by <strong>applying a modifier of
	  -10ℏ</strong>, plus any other eventual swing modifiers;</li>
	<li>Have the PC roll a <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ</span>, if
	  the roll comes out positive the PC overcomes the
	  challenge.</li>
      </ol>

      <aside class="example">
	<p>Remember Yuvash' the gnome, who had stepped into a trap?
	  By comparing Yuvash' <em>evasion</em> capability (5) to the
	  trap's challenge score (6) the might of the roll had been
	  determined to be -1.</p>
	<p>Because Yuvash is rolling against a trap, an inanimated
	  object, the swing of the roll must be adjusted by -10ℏ,
	  so <span class="nowrap">σ ≈ 5.657</span>.  Yuvash rolls
	  5.657dφ - 1 and gets 1.02. The trap snaps close but Yuvash
	  escapes it by a hair.</p>

      <h3 id="critical" class="optional">Critical boost</h3>

      <p>Because a dφ can roll any value from -∞ to +∞, no action is
	ever impossible.  However some results may be so unlikely that
	you couldn't hope them to happen in a game session, or even in
	your whole gaming carreer.  When the might gets smaller than
	-4σ, the chancs of success become less than 1 in 10,000.</p>

      <p>Some game systems are founded on the postulate that every
	roll must have a non-negligble probability of success (and of
	failure).  The most obvious example is the critical hit/miss
	in D&amp;D.</p>

      <p>As an optional rule, you may decide to set a minimum
	probability of success/failure for all rolls. We call this
	the <strong>critical boost</strong>. A critical boost of 5%
	matches exactly the critical rolls on a d20. Smaller critical
	boosts, e.g, 2% or even 1% are also pretty common.</p>

      <p>In the Rollφ tools, we represent the critical bonus as red
	strips at the ends of the distribution. A roll falling in the
	right strip is always a success, a roll falling in the left
	strip always a failure. Play with the widget below by chaning
	the value of the critical boost.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>The critical boost is the fastest path to integrating dφ in a
	pre-existing system that uses critical rolls, such as D&amp;D,
	but it is not a native concept in dφ and we don't recommend
	using it. Indeed, it is at odds with other mechanics in dφ,
	such as splitting dice rolls.  If your main reason for wanting
	a critical boost is to have some rolls achieve a better result
	than the usual success (e.g., dealing more damage on a
	critical hit), we recommend using
	the <a href="#quality"><em>roll quality</em> rule</a>
	instead.</p>
      
      <h3 id="quality" class="optional">Roll quality</h3>

      <p>After all, if the survival of your party depends on

      <p>Remember that every check in dφ is resolved by
	rolling <span class="nowrap">σdφ + μ</span>, where σ is the

      <p>You want to have a certain balance between the base swing and

      <p>You have two approaches to choose Σ. The first is when the
	statistics of characters and objects are already decided, for
	example if you're integrating dφ into a pre-existing game.  In
	this case, choose the smallest might with which a character
	may still hope to pass a check (e.g., <span class="nowrap">μ =
	-10</span>), and set Σ so that it assigns a non-zero
	probability (e.g., something in the range from 2% to 5%).  Use
	the dφ visualization tools to help you make this choice.  A
	larger Σ will make the game more unpredictable, a smaller one
	will make it more deterministic.</p>

      <p>The second approach is to first choose Σ and then make the
	statistics accordingly. In this case Σ could be anything, but
	remember that 68.3% of the rolls will fall within -Σ and +Σ,
	and 95.4% of them will fall within -2Σ and +2Σ, so maybe don't
	choose too small a Σ.  Values of Σ between 5 and 50 are
	reasonable.</p>

      <p>After you've chosen Σ, you can set the game's statistics. A
	good technique is to choose a fraction of Σ—we call this
	the <strong>minor swing</strong>—and set the statistics as
	multiples of it. For example if you set <span class="nowrap">Σ
	= 8</span>, then increasing one statistic by +1 will increase
	the chances of passing a check based on it by at most 5%.  So,
	for <span class="nowrap">Σ = 8</span>, a +1 modifier is quite
	similar to a +1 modifier on the d20, and is a decent choice
	for the minor swing.  Note, however, that the advantage gained
	by adding +1 becomes smaller as the might increases: if you
	already have a +8 modifier, moving to +9 only increases your
	chances by 2.8%. The chart below lets you visualize how much
	adding a fraction of Σ adds to the success probability.</p>

	    left = parseFloat($('#minor-range').value),
	    right = left + 8/ms;
	    $('#minor-left').textContent = ($('#minor-swing').left = left).toFixed(2);
 	    $('#minor-right').textContent = ($('#minor-swing').right = right).toFixed(2);
	    $('#minor-swing-b').textContent = ms;
	  }

      <p>When in doubt, we suggest using a <strong>base swing
	  of <span class="nowrap">Σ = 8</span></strong> and
	  a <strong>minor swing of +1</strong>. These values give a
	  reasonable balance between randomness and determinism, and
	  are fine-grained enough to express plenty of nuance in
	  characters and objects. Most examples in this guide use
	  these values. Only when we adapt dφ to other game systems we
	  may use different values.</p>
